# 🏏 IPL Win Predictor - Machine Learning Project

This project predicts the winning probabilities of an ongoing IPL (Indian Premier League) match based on real-time match data using machine learning. It features a logistic regression model deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit web app.

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses two datasets from [Kaggle IPL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets):

- `matches.csv`: Match-level data (teams, city, winner, etc.)
- `deliveries.csv`: Ball-by-ball data (runs, wickets, players, etc.)
